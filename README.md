The project aims to create simple JavaScript games whose size is less than 1Ko.
It all started with this toot: https://hostux.coffee/notice/9usam1cRQCbvt4fipU
All games are playable at: https://mbodin.github.io/1Jeu1Ko/

These constraints force these games to be minimalistic in nature.
It also makes bad coding practises.

Pull request are welcomed.
Sharing is also welcomed (suggested hashtag #1Jeu1Ko).
Enjoy!
